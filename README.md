## What is this About?
Many companies are severely impacted by the growing coronavirus outbreak and had to cancel summer internships and pause expansion into new directions. Such unexpected, last-minute changes also cause many qualified students to lose valuable opportunities to gain industry experience.
We build this open platform to help students seek meaningful project experience during the summer, and facilitate companies in exploring new ideas quickly.

Please note that even though companies can hire students for regular summer internships here, we would like to focus on
* Unpaid projects or sponsored projects with no more than $3000 for the whole project
* Students spend at least 20 hours per week.
* Projects can be conducted remotely
